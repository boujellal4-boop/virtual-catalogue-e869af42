This cost-effective option is ideal for installations where a full display is not required. The modular design allows separate centrally-controllable detector modules to be configured independently. Simplified installation with the ingenious docking station design reduces commissioning time. The easy pipe connection with quick fit adaptor system enables rapid pipe routing. Self-contained detector modules allow quick location of smoke. Zoned aspirating smoke detection provides targeted coverage. The module integrates seamlessly with other ModuLaser components via SenseNET.",
